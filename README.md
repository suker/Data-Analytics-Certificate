## TRANSFORMING DATA INTO INSIGHTS

#### Data Analytics: the science of data

#### DATA
**A collection of facts or information.**

### DATA ANALYSIS
The collection, transformation and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions and drive informed decision-making.

THE SIX STEPS OF THE DATA ANALYSIS PROCESS ARE:
1. **ASK questions to define the problem.** (*Business Challenge/Objective/Question*)
2. **PREPARE data by collecting and storing the information.** (*Data generation, colleciton, storage and management*).
4. **PROCESS data by cleaning and checking the information.**(*Data cleaning/Data integrity*)
5. **ANALYZE data to find patterns, relationships and trends.**(*Data exploration, visualization and analysis*)
6. **SHARE data with yout audience.** (*communicating and interpreting results*)
7. **ACT on the data and use the analysis results.**(*Putting your insights to work to solve the problem*).


### WHAT IS BUSINESS ANALYTICS?

Business analytics is **"the use of math and statistics to derive meaning from data in order to make better business decisions"**

There are three types of business analytics: **descriptive, predictive and prescriptive**.
- **Descriptive analytics**: is the intrerpretation of historical data to identify trends and patterns.
- **Predictive analytics**: centers on taking that information and using it to forecast future outcomes.
- **Prescriptive analytics**: testing and other techniques are employed to determine which outcome will yield (*producir*) the best result in a give scenario.

Across industries, these data-driven approaches (*enfoques basados en datos*) have been employed by professionals to make informed business decisions (*decisiones comerciales informadas*)and attain organizational success.




## UNDERSTANDING THE DATA ECOSYSTEM
**The various elements that interact with one another in order to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze and share data.**

### Difference between Data Scientists vs Data Analyst

#### Data science

Creating new ways of modeling and understanding the unknown by using raw data.
 
 **Data scientists create new questions using data**, while **data analysts find answer to existing questions** by creating insights from data sources.

 ### data-driven decision-making (*toma de decisiones basada en datos*)
 
 Using facts to guide business strategy
 
 The first step in data-driven decision-making is **figuring out the business need.**
 
 
 ### How do I define success for a project?

Successful analysis needs to be accurate, and fast enough to help decision-makers. So try asking yourself these questions about a project:
 - What kind of results are needed?
 - Who will be informed? 
 - Am I answering the question being asked?
 - How quickly does a decision need to be made?


## OTHER VARIATIONS OF THE DATA ANALYSIS LIFE CYCLE

  <summary>EMC's data analysis life cycle</summary>
  
  **EMC Corporation's data analytics life cycle is cyclical with six steps:**
  
  1. Discovery
  2. Pre-processing data
  3. Model planning
  4. Model building
  5. Communicate results
  6. Operationalize

<details>
  <summary>SAS' iterative life cycle</summary>
  
  An iterative life cycle was created by a company called SAS, a leading data analytics   solutions provider. It can be used to produce repeatable, reliable, and predictive     results:
  
  1. Ask
  2. Prepare
  3. Explore
  4. Model
  5. Implement
  6. Act
  7. Evaluate

  <summary>Project-based data analytics life cycle </summary>
  
  **A project-based data analytics life cycle has five simple steps:**
  
  1. Identifying the problem
  2. Designing data requirements
  3. Pre-processing data
  4. Data analysis
  5. Data visualizing

  <summary>Big data analytics life cycle</summary>
  
  Authors Thomas Erl, Wajid Khattak, and Paul Buhler proposed a big data analytics life   cycle in their book, Big Data Fundamentals: Concepts, Drivers & Techniques. Their       life cycle suggests phases divided into nine steps:
  
  1. Business case evaluation
  2. Data identification
  3. Data acquisition and filtering
  4. Data extraction
  5. Data validation and cleaning
  6. Data aggregation and representation
  7. Data analysis
  8. Data visualization
  9. Utilization of analysis results

  One final data life cycle informed by Harvard University research has eight phases:
  
  1. Generation
  2. Collection
  3. Processing
  4. Storage management
  5. Analysis
  6. Visualization
